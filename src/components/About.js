            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            I am 21 and currently studying for my BS in Computer Science at GMU. Computer programs and the quality they have to 
            present and transfer any form of information the author is capable of conceiving has always been a topic of interest 
            for me. From medical equipment to online banking, computer software is turning into a staple of all aspects of life 
            which is why I spend so much time learning about the craft.
